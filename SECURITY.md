## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of **VirusProtect** seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.** This allows malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability before we can fix it.
2.  Email the security team at **dharaneeshrs@proton.me** (replace with actual email) or open a **Security Advisory** in the GitHub repository if enabled.
3.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and strive to provide a fix as soon as possible.

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers. If you are conducting security research on this project:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service.
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
- If you find a vulnerability, please report it to us first before disclosing it publicly.
